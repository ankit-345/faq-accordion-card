![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](images/Capture.PNG)

# Tech Stack Used

- HTML - to form the structure
- CSS & Bootstrap- I have used flexbox to design the structure
- Javascript - used to implement dynamic behaviour when the button is clicked.

# What I have Learned?

- In javascript, how to select various element from the html including child element from the parent element and the parent element from the child element.

# Difficulty ?

- The most difficult part was to put javascript in the accordion to make it dynamic.
- I still haven't done the part where when we open one section of the accordion, then 
  all the other parts will close.
- I will make it complete.
